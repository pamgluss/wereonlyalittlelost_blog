Welcome to my blog! Thanks for checking me out!

My name is Pam, and I'm an engineer based out of Austin, TX. 

I started this blog way back in 2016 [on Tumblr](https://wereonlyalittlelost.tumblr.com/) when I did my cross country road trip from Rochester, NY to San Francisco, CA. While back then it was to let my parents know I was alive, I continued the blog for all my trips and treks...

If you'd like to make a suggestion for somewhere for me to eat, drink, hike, explore, whatever, throw me a line at pamela@gluss.com
