description: "Hi! I'm Pam!"

My name is Pam, and I'm a software engineer based out of San Francisco, California.

I started this blog way back in 2016 [on Tumblr](https://wereonlyalittlelost.tumblr.com/) when I did my cross country road trip from Rochester, NY to San Francisco, CA. Back then it was to let my parents know I was alive, now I continue the blog for all my trips and treks...

I have a [pretty ambitious bucket list](/about/bucket_list/bucket_list) but if you'd like to make a suggestion for somewhere for me to eat, drink, hike, explore, whatever, throw me a line at pamela@gluss.com

This blog is written in Markdown using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) with a customized [Ananke](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) theme. It is deployed via TravisCI to S3 where it becomes the static website you see here! I hope you like it and I recommend it for your blogging and portfolio website needs.
