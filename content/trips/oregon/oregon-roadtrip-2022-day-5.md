I woke up bright and early today to go down to breakfast at 7 AM (totally unnecessary it turns out, it goes on until 9 AM). I had my coffee and food and hung out downstairs briefly. It was pretty simple fair, like continental but a little extra effort in the hot food.

I was very preoccupied with running late. I had about an hour and a half drive to Portland and I wanted to be on time to pick up my boyfriend from the airport at noon. The previous night the bartender had warned it could snow on the road today so I wanted to account extra time for that.

I wish in retrospect I had slept in an extra thirty minutes because I was way too early!

I first drove up to the [Astoria Column](https://astoriacolumn.org/). It's talked about quite a bit in the visiting Astoria guides I was reading while planning. And it is totally worth going to! It's up on a big hill and has wonderful 360 views of the entire city and surrounding area.

There is a trail here you can use to walk instead of drive called [Cathedral Tree Trail](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Cathedral_Tree-Coxcomb_Hill_Hike). I only found it when I was already there. I considered doing the walk because I had the extra time but it's kind of long and reviews online mentioned it being steep and muddy. 

I was feeling a bit cold and lazy so I decided to skip it and just move on.

I got gas and some more snacks in town. It's weird having someone else pump your gas for you! I was still going to be very early to Portland so I picked out two random state parks from Google maps to pop in at:
* Bradley State Scenic Viewpoint - basically just a bathroom and a view of the river
* Paradise Point State Park - has a campsite but it's right next to a freeway

So basically neither were much to write home about. I didn't mind getting the bathroom breaks though, and I did briefly cross into Washington.

It didn't end up snowing too much if at all on the drive over. I just ended up parking in the cellphone lot and writing in my journal until my boyfriend landed!

We headed straight to lunch at [Nong's Khao Man Gai](https://khaomangai.com/). This place showed up on Portland visiting guides and was recommended by my coworkers as well. I don't eat Thai chicken and rice very often (I'm a pad thai basic bitch if I'm being honest) so I don't have much to compare it to but I did appreciate how tender the chicken was and how soft the rice was.

We got an Airbnb in the Nob Hill neighborhood. I thought it might be easier to keep our car further out from downtown. I didn't really realize Nob Hill is its own mini San Francisco. First of all, parking was quite difficult, even with our car being on the neighborhood parking pass.

Second, there were a bunch of restaurants and stores in our Airbnb's neighborhood that are literally the same group of restaurants and stores in my boyfriend's neighborhood in San Francisco. It was a bit uncanny actually!

Once we were settled in a bit, I took a 2 hour nap! All the beer and driving had finally caught up to me.

For dinner we kept going down the list of recommended restaurants and headed to [Grassa](https://www.grassapdx.com/), right down the street. I got the pesto and my boyfriend got the cacio e pepe. I liked mine well enough but I don't think it's really to my taste of how I usually eat pasta. In the sense it was a bit salty and al dente.

I will say getting a nice dinner out with wine and having it only cost 30 dollars for the two of us is pretty amazing!

The night turned into a classic datenight and we went to see [Everything, Everywhere, All at Once](https://a24films.com/films/everything-everywhere-all-at-once) at the theater in the neighborhood. It was a really good movie and I actually haven't been to a theater to see a movie SINCE COVID! So it was nice to get that normal experience again.

Finally we walked over to [Salt & Straw](https://saltandstraw.com/) for a nightcap ice cream cone. I have no idea how we fit it in after all the popcorn and pasta. I didn't mention Salt & Straw on the itinerary because we have them in San Francisco and they're definitely not a Portland thing. The ice cream is really good though.
