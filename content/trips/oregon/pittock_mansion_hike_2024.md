My friends invited me on their college reunion trip that they do every year. This year, they decided to do it on the west coast at Lake Oswego, Oregon. That's 15-20 minutes roughly speaking outside of Portland. I'll always jump on the chance to visit the Pacific Northwest again!

This post is about [Pittock Mansion](https://pittockmansion.org/). It's a big historic house sort of in the area of [Washington Park](https://explorewashingtonpark.org/) which my partner and I had explored almost [exactly 2 years previously](../oregon-roadtrip-2022-day-6/). You can totally just drive there and walk along the grounds and take a tour inside.

Or, you could take a nice hike! We elected to do [this route](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/pittock-mansion-via-wildwood-trail) which clocks in at a relaxing 2.6 miles. Although while googling to find details of the hike for this post I also found this [website which has a route for 5.7 miles round trip](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Pittock_Mansion_Hike).

Here's how our hike went:

It's a pretty nice hike for basically being in the city. A lot of wildflowers and big trees. We just parked on the side of the road there and walked to the trailhead.

I didn't really take many pictures during the hike because we were talking so much.

At the actual mansion there's a nice overlook of Portland and Mount Hood. This is definitely worth seeing and we were so lucky it was a beautiful clear day.

There's the house and grounds itself which also has an interesting history. It costs extra to go inside so we didn't bother.

Then we just headed back the way we came to get back to our cars.

Overall this whole area is so special! I'll probably have to come back to Washington Park multiple more times to actually see everything inside. This route was also easy enough to do with a group of casual hikers but still felt really natural and outdoorsy.
