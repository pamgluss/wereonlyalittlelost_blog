Aw man! The trip had to come to an end eventually :(

In Bend, we started out day out getting breakfast at [The Sparrow Bakery Northwest](https://www.thesparrowbakery.net/). The original location apparently had a lot of sparrows flying around, hence the name. The Ocean Roll is a famous type of pastry with cardamom and vanilla. I didn't really like it that much because cardamom is weird in my opinion. I did get a lox bagel and a mocha and was overall impressed with the pastries though.

Today we unfortunately had an **8 hour drive** home. I planned one pit stop at Castle Crags State Park in California but that was it. So we couldn't dawdle long in Bend.

Not a lot to report about the drive. We listened to a lot of podcasts. I'd never listened to [My Brother, My Brother and Me](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/) before. 

Gas went back up a whole dollar and a half when we crossed the California border. It's a huge bummer. I'll miss how affordable Oregon was. We passed back through Weed and saw Shasta in all its glory.

We got to [Castle Crags](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=454) nearby Shasta. I knew I wanted to keep it simple and not kill us with any hard hikes so I picked out the Vista Point Overlook trail which is 0.3 miles. 

What I didn't know is that it's up a long, one way, twisty as heck road. It's a little sketchy getting up there in anything bigger than a sedan but surprisingly worth it.

From the overlook you can see the crags of the state park in one direction and Mount Shasta in the other:

From there we bombed 4 hours back to the Bay Area to shower and stare at a wall to recover. 

It was an incredible trip with so many unforgettable sights and experiences. I truly cannot recommend the Pacific Northwest enough!

To close, I just wanted to drop a few links if you're planning your own Oregon road trip. Let me know what you think!
