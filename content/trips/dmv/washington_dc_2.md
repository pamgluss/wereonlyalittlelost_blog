During the week we were working remotely so we didn't have as much time to do things. We did go out a few times to meet back up with my cousin and my friend so I'll basically be covering some more restaurants and bars in this post.

Monday we worked and then went out to dinner in Falls Church. We headed to a spot called [Dogwood Tavern.](https://www.dogwoodtavern.com/). I got the cheesesteak sandwich and fried macaroni balls. I think the food was fine, and the area is supposed to be historic, but you'd basically only come here if you were staying in the area.

Wednesday we met up with Matt again for dinner. We have a car and wanted to meet him closer to where he lived, so we picked out [Founding Farmer's](https://www.wearefoundingfarmers.com/menus/) in Potomac, Maryland. This was just a random choice, no recommendation. Not totally sure I recommend it either since it's nestled in an apartment-mall similar to the Domain in Austin. That being said the food was pretty good, we had cornbread and I got spicy fried chicken. The margarita I got was kind of whatever but their lemonade was really good.

If you're looking for things in Bethesda, try out [Casa Oaxaca](https://www.casaoaxacamd.com/) and the adjacent beer garden, [Dog Haus](https://bethesda.doghaus.com/). I can't personally vouch for them but they came recommended to me!

Thursday we went back to Adams Morgan to meet up with my cousin and get a drink or two. 18th street there is popping -- tons of restaurants and bars! It was pretty busy there on a Thursday night but we managed to snag an outside table at [Meze](https://mezedc.com/). Originally we were intending to go to [Perry's](https://www.perrysam.com/), on Columbia, but it didn't have outdoor seating. I think if you get there early enough you can sit on the rooftop!

Friday is when we headed for Winchester, where we're staying in an Airbnb to explore some more of Virginia and go to a wedding. It's about an hour drive from DC, and I'll be posting more about our stay here soon!
