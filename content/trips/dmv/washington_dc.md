I'm posting this about a week late so I will be summarizing my trip to DC pretty heavily. I was staying in Arlington -- about 20-25 minutes outside the city -- and spent a weekend and one or two weekdays in the city.

Saturday was the main show of meeting up with some college friends. We started in Georgetown which is known for its architecture and bougie restaurants. Here is what came recommended in Georgetown:

- Kintaro for Asian food
- Filomena Ristorante for Italian
- Baked and Wired for pastries and coffee

Since Georgetown was the first thing we did, we were aiming for Baked and Wired for coffee and brunch. The first thing I learned about the area is that it's both impossible to get there via metro and also incredibly difficult to park. Baked and Wired had a line down the block so it ended up being a complete no go. The views along the canal are nice enough and I do think the row houses have their charm.

The walk to the waterfront and along the Potomoc is not too hard from Georgetown. From this picture you can actually see the Watergate building.

The next stop was the Mall. An iconic DC destination that did not disappoint! Parking at the mall is of course impossible and I don't recommend it. As a Californian I find the parking sign system in DC to be incomprehensible. We ended up parking probably 3/4 of a mile away and walking in.

You'll be doing a lot of walking around the mall and seeing a lot of impressive buildings. There are also museums and galleries that are well worth visiting, we just didn't have time this trip.

The capital building:

The Lincoln Memorial:

The Washington Memorial:

I should note it was quite hot out on Saturday so we spent some time in the shade of the Washington monument. We also saw a protest against the violence in Israel while walking around.

For dinner and drinks we hit up [Wunder Garten](https://www.wundergartendc.com/). It has two food trucks for food and of course beer. The music was way too loud in my opinion but we were able to be switched to a quieter table. There are actually a couple of other beer gardens I meant to check out in DC but didn't quite get the time -- [Dacha](https://dachadc.com/) and [The Brig](https://www.thebrigdc.com/)

Sunday we met up with my cousin at the [US National Arboretum](https://www.usna.usda.gov/). The random pillars in the middle of a field were originally from the Capitol building but moved in the 1980's.

The bonsai section was actually closed because of COVID but we snuck some photos in through the glass windows;

Afterwards we drove my cousin home to Adams Morgan neighborhood. There's a pizza place there we got a fresh tomato and sausage pizza from called [Vace](https://www.thrillist.com/venues/eat/washington-dc/restaurants/vace) which is actually an Italian deli. You can also buy homemade pasta and sauces from there. Tom got some pesto although we haven't tried it yet!

Adams Morgan is a very cool little neighborhood. My cousin doesn't live too far away from where the Obamas live, as well as a bunch of other famous government related people.
