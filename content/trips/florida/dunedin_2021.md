My parents have a place in Dunedin which is a town about forty minutes from Tampa. We decided to go there to meet them for Christmas this year and had a wonderful Christmas with our typical traditions and plenty of wine to go around!

While here, we did two things: We took my parents' bicycles out for a ride through the local [Hammock Park](https://hammockpark.org/). One big difference between here and San Francisco or Oakland is that you can just bicycle through town and through a park with no hills whatsoever! It's a really nice ride but pretty sandy in the park. My parents also noted it can be easy to get lost in there.

We also rented a pontoon boat from [Anclote Village Marina](https://www.anclotevillagemarina.com/) and headed out to Anclote Key.

On the ride out to the island, we saw dolphins in the water!

It was a tiny bit chilly for swimming but it was perfectly nice for eating lunch on the sand and walking along the beach to look at and collect sea shells.
