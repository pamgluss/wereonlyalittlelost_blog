Today we got up to get breakfast and coffee at [Hoshino Coffee](https://www.hoshinocoffee.com/) which is a chain in Japan. I got a breakfast sandwich and a coffee.

Our main plan for the day was [Teamlab Planets Tokyo](https://planets.teamlab.art/tokyo/). This is an art exhibit slash sensory experience. Sort of between a normal art museum, Museum of Ice Cream style Instagram photo ops and something like Meow Wolf. For Teamlab Planets specifically you take your shoes off and walk through this maze of sorts with different rooms that have their own sensory experience and story. 

For instance the first part we walked in the near dark through a tunnel of warm water, but there were a bunch and it was all pretty different.

The LED rainfall room was a classic and super cool. You can also get an app that lets you interact with some of the exhibits.

This one was knee deep warm water with projections of koi fish swimming on the surface. The fish would explode into petals when they were interrupted by a guest.

Some of these big balls could be rolled around and they slowly changed colors over time.

After that, we headed over to [Diver City Tokyo](https://mitsui-shopping-park.com/divercity-tokyo/en/shopguide/) to see the giant Gundam statue, get food and do a little shopping. We also hit up the arcade (where we won two toys from the claw machines!) and the Gundam model museum and shop.

Lunch was at the food court. Nothing like getting mall food in the US that's for sure.

I never thought I'd see so many Gundam figurines in my life. There are some really elaborate ones and I learned there's a [pretty detailed ranking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam_model#Grades) for size of the Gundam and fidelity of the details. For instance, there's 1/100 size of a "real" Gundam that could be considered "Master class" grade.

For dinner we got [Tsukada Shabu Shabu](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1303/A130301/13240513/). Saturday night was brutal finding a place to eat in Shibuya. We stopped by Tsukada on the 12th floor and were told to expect an hour and a half wait. So we walked around town trying to find anything else with a better wait time but got turned away from everywhere else so ended up circling back and getting our original spot.

It ended up being worth it coming back, I thought the meat and the broth were incredible!
