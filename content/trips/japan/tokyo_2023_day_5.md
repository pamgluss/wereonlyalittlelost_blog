Monday was our final day in Tokyo. For breakfast, we went to [Cafe 1886](https://www.bosch-cafe.jp/) which is actually the lobby cafe for a local Bosch office. It was funny because I thought it was just a themed cafe for a _while_. They've got Bosch products on display and the order number stands were machining prototype blocks. While it's pretty funny to eat a random company cafe on vacation, the food and coffee were actually pretty good.

This was an electric BMW scooter on display:

I got the C set which is yogurt, fruit, granola and maple syrup. I think my boyfriend's meal was a bit heartier.

It was alright that we weren't too full though as our next stop was the [Tsukiji Fish Market](https://www.tsukiji.or.jp/english/). This is marketplace with stalls on the street selling fruit, cooked meats, fish and shellfish and so much more. We stopped at a few stalls sampling and snacking including wagyu beef on a stick (incredible), inarizushi, fruit, and mochi ice cream.

There's also a food court indoors with hot foods and a place to sit down and eat. Over there we got a sashimi bowl, ramen, and soda with ice cream in it.

I probably could've stayed even longer to try a few more things but we headed out after eating. 

On our way back to the train station, we stopped by a cool little store called [Oonoya](http://www.ginza-oonoya.com/). Originally it was the kimono on the rack outside the store that caught our eyes but they were a bit on the expensive side. Inside we found cute little purses and I bought myself a new scrunchie.

We also stopped to get a curry bread at a window in a building called [Tsukiji KY Building](https://kkaa.co.jp/en/project/tsukiji-ky-building/) -- we can't currently find the name of the actual restaurant or business that sold it to us though. So while I don't think you need to go out of your way to go to that particular place, you definitely need to have curry bread at least once. It's the texture of a fried pieroshki but with curry meat on the inside.

We wanted a pick me up so we headed to get boba at a place that actually has US locations known as [Truedan](https://www.truedan.com.tw/product_en.php) -- they're known for their brown sugar boba and I do really like their locations in San Francisco. In Japan it seems like it's also known as Jenjudan and this particular location is in a mall type building called [Magnet](https://magnetbyshibuya109.jp/en/).

We didn't get a good chance to walk around the shops but from what I saw it looked like it would've been really fun. 

Nearby was the gaming cafe that the boys wanted to play at called [CR Gaming Space](https://crazyraccoon.jp/). It's a classy joint with big cubicles of computers with a bunch of games pre-installed. It's also apparently free to play there which is crazy awesome. While the gents played League, the gals parted ways. Our friend went to get a haircut and I headed back to the hotel to work on this blog!

For dinner we ate at a place called [Gyūkaku Jiyūgaoka](https://www.gyukaku.ne.jp/) which is a yakiniku style restaurant where you order raw slices of meat and cook them yourself on a grill in the center of the table. We loved it here and enjoyed all our dishes and our [Umeshu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umeshu) sodas.

Of course while in Japan we need to do karaoke. That night we headed to [Rainbow Karaoke Shibuya](https://www.karaoke-rainbow.com/) for more drinking, some singing, and surprisingly good food.

The fruit pizza was better than it had any right to be with marshmallow frosting.

We had to get up early the next day to catch our flight to Sapporo so we didn't stay up too late or drink too much!
