I thought it might be nice to include a bulleted list of destinations and resources so that if you're planning your own trip, you can just grab information from here without having to dig through all my journals. Of course, I still recommend looking through the rest of the blog posts to see detailed advice and thoughts plus pictures!

Trip planning was heavily facilitated and tracked using an app called [WanderLog](https://wanderlog.com/). Here's a [link to our completed Wanderlog itinerary](https://wanderlog.com/view/esrtuynxwq/japan-2023/shared) as well.

If you've read all the way to here then, thank you!

My closing thoughts on the Japan trip are that Japan is an incredible country with a lot of great food, people, infrastructure and sights to see. The cleanliness and ease of getting around are something we should certainly aspire to.

I was worried about culture shock but I sincerely felt like everyone I interacted with in Japan were so polite and accomodating. 

I studied Japanese for a few months with [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) which taught me probably 5-10% of the non-Kanji characters and approximately 10 phrases that I used every so often. Probably the most useful phrases I learned at the very very end when I learned how to ask "do you have X? Is this Y?"

Finally being on a 3 week vacation was pretty wild. I could let go of work for the first two weeks but the third week I started to get stressed about work and worrying about what I was missing. I didn't know what to expect with that. 

By the way, there's still a TON left to explore in Japan. I can't wait to go back some day!
