I've been going to PAX since 2014 although, historically, to PAX East in Boston. You can refer back to my Tumblr blog for those. I've also been to PAX prime back when my sister lived in Seattle.

So this was my first time trying PAX South in San Antonio, Texas. I've been to San Antonio twice now but I'd never been to the convention center.

I woke up around 7 to prepare my makeup but I actually ended up sticking with just eyeliner and the contacts. I thought it'd take me longer to get them in too.

My coworker picked us up and drove us to the center.

My impression walking into the expo is that it's much smaller than East or Prime. There were also no big name video game companies with booths. So half the space was for indie games, the other half was for tabletop games. This didn't surprise me because I heard South was more focused on board games.

People asked to take my picture a handful of times which was cool.

I got third place in Steel Battalion which is worse than I did the year before

Shariq and I played a board game called Love Fog where you essentially build and role play a romantic comedy. I was Josh the short, smelly, hypocritical musician and Shariq was Aubrey the slow talking TV star. It was amusing but complicated.

For lunch Shariq, my coworker, his friend and I did the San Antonio River Walk to a restaurant called the Iron Cactus.

It was a nice break with fresh air and we did a section of the river walk I haven't done before. This one had lots of restaurants and stalls which was cool but dangerous with the narrow path.

The only panel I made it to was on using games in education. My mom is a teacher so it could've been interesting but I think the vocabulary of the presentation was geared to teachers and hard to understand as not a teacher 

We also played some Azul with my coworker and his friend but I actually have that game at home!

I had fun at PAX South and I'm glad I dressed up and I'm glad I continued this tradition!
