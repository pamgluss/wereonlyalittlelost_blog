Monday was President's Day and we both had it taken off from work. Since we've been going out and about so much all weekend, we took it easy today with breakfast and coffee at the house and wrapping up in blankets with popcorn to watch the Pixar short Bao and then Pan's Labrynth. 

This was the night we were going to make our homemade pasta, so we stopped by Wegman's for our missing ingredients and some more wine and got to work. In case you'd like more in depth instructions, I highly recommend this [Binging With Babish episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdSLKZ6LN94).

First we made the dough by creating a crater of flour and putting eggs in the middle

You scramble the eggs slowly to let the movement of the eggs grab some of the flour on the edges, then start flipping some of the flour in. Continue doing this until you start to get a dough forming. Then you can start kneading.

Continue kneading and adding flour until the dough can be cut without getting sticky. This is all about feel and I only just learned how to do this myself so don't take my word for it! According to Babish this is about 10-15 minutes of kneading, which is about how long we used. We had a pasta machine on hand so that was our next step:

First you flatten the pasta down starting with the 0 width setting all the way to the 7 width setting. It starts to get pretty long and thin. Some amount of puckering is okay. Then we reattached the cutting mechanism and fed that long band through there to get pasta! It's really surreal to see fettucine just come out magically and looking great. Make sure to flour the dough before feeding it through the cutter so the noodles don't stick together.

Finally we can boil it and eat it! Fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried pasta and has a springier texture once cooked. Delicious!

For dessert Tom made crepes and I put granulated sugar and honey on mine since we forgot to get nutella.
