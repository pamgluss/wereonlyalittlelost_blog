Today we ran some errands in the morning including getting a work suit for Tom's roommate and picking up some more beer and wine.

We made plans to meet Shariq and his girlfriend at [the MFA](https://www.mfa.org/) at 2 PM so we had to hustle home to make and eat breakfast. We got to the museum right on time where we were able to get in for free thanks to Megan's membership.

We had about 2 and a half hours to walk around. We spent a decent amount of time looking at African art and art of the Americas but we were able to look at some modern art and some ship models.

At 5 PM the museum closed so we had to grab our coats and walk out. We decided to drive a few blocks away to [Pavement Coffeehouse](https://pavementcoffeehouse.com/) to have a quick coffee and chat before Tom and I had to head out to get ready for our dinner reservation.

We had about thirty minutes at home to get ready and it was WAY too cold out to wear the dress I brought so I stayed with my jeans and sweater. Tom picked out [Blu](http://www.blurestaurant.com/), a restaurant located inside the Equinox Hotel. We parked in the Boston Common but we didn't get a chance to enjoy the park because it was dark and FREEZING!

I ordered us some white wine (which of course I now forget the name of) which didn't turn out to be that good. It did not pair well with the lamb in the tapas plate we got to start with, but it did pair nicely with the swordfish I got:

The swordfish wasn't so bad but the really nice touch was the lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus that came with it.
