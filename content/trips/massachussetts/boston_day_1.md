My flight last night was delayed to nearly 8 PM which resulted in me arriving in Boston at 1 AM! My Valentine's day card I made at the work happy hour yesterday evening barely made it through security and the flight. 

The man next to me on the flight lied about having a broken TV screen to get two free shots of bourbon. I saw his TV turn on later! Sneaky! I stayed in my lane and didn't say anything.

Today is a very chill day since I have to work remotely, but I was happy to be served breakfast and coffee and advil. I'm on the tail end of recovering from a cold.

We had a lazy night where Tom made fried rice with chicken for dinner and we got most of the way through Halo Remastered.
