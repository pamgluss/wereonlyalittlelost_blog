Sunday was another late morning (maybe all the staying up until 2 AM playing Halo?) but this time we ran out of breakfast food at home. I picked out [McKenna's Diner](https://www.mckennascafe.com/) which wasn't too far away for late brunch. The wait was kind of intense here and the sytem is ruthless. They only call your name inside and the waiting area inside is very small and crowded.

While we were waiting to popped over the [Honeycome Cafe](https://www.honeycombcafe.biz/) for coffee to keep ourselves warm and caffeined while we waited for McKenna's. I didn't actually like my mocha that much, I can't really recommend.

Once we were finally seated, I got coffee and huevos rancheros. I am particular about my huevos rancheros. These were no [Alice's](http://www.alicesrestaurant.com/) but they weren't half bad and I ate the whole thing. The bite of pancakes I got from Tom were really delicious as well.

We finished up there and headed home to get ready to head out again for [Boda Borg](https://www.bodaborg.com/locations/boston/). Boda Borg is a Swedish escape room-esque activity that has many rooms with different kinds of puzzles that you work through with a small team. We met up with Tom's friends and successfully completed three rooms which involved puzzles of a wide variety - move light with mirrors, step on the proper blocks, play a game of guess who, solve a sphinx's riddle, press buttons to get through a system's defense. The solutions weren't always obvious and we spent a whole hour on one of the rooms.

The last few rooms we did we were having less success with - Spookhouse for example was too hard for us to figure out. Overall we were there from 4:30 PM until nearly 9 PM. After we were thoroughly exhausted, we got dinner nearby at [Pho Bistro](http://www.phobistromalden.com/). I got my normal three beef cut pho and it was everything I could've wanted. The egg rolls only come with two rolls and the shrimp egg rolls came with four. The small portions were okay though because they were delicious.
