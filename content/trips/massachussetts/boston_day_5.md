My last morning in Boston! I was sad to leave but probably also a little happy to go to a state where there's no winter!

My flight wasn't until 3 PM so we had time to get some last goodies. We went to [Toscanini's Ice Cream](https://www.tosci.com/) in Cambridge right when it opened at 10:30 AM. I ended up with a double scoop of salted caramel ice cream for breakfast.

It was so delicious! Also ridiculously decadant and I definitely ruined my appetite. Unfortunately for me, our next stop was lunch at [Parish Cafe](https://parishcafe.com/) on Boylston Street, not too far from Newberry. Each sandwich is crafted by a different chef from restaurants around Boston. I got the brisket sandwich.

If I hadn't eaten so much rich ice cream I might've taken more than two bites but man those two bites were delicious. No regrets about how my day was spent whatsoever!

I had to go straight from the airport from there and say goodbye to Boston for the time being.
