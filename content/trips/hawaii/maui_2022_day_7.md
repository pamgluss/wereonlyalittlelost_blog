Aloha! This post sadly will cover the final two days of our trip to Hawaii. We wanted to show our friends our snorkel spot, spend some time drinking pi√±a coladas by the pool, celebrate our friend's birthday with a sushi boat, visit an aquarium, and then head home.

[See day 5-6 here](/trips/hawaii/maui_2022_day_5/).

Friday
===
To start the day, we headed to [Whaler's Village](https://www.whalersvillage.com/en.html) to do a little shopping. Basically I got fried to a crisp while snorkeling the day before and I was considering getting a sun shirt. I also needed new flip flops since mine had been annihilated by the hot sand (to be fair to them they were also very old). It's a pretty cool spot to do some shopping and get coffee.

Then, we wanted to show our friends our snorkel spot down the beach, so we all walked down and got snorkel equipment. It was still lovely, but we didn't see turtles this time, and I think my boyfriend and I were both still exhausted from all the swimming the previous day. 

Thankfully we had a private cabana rental at our resort. So we got lunch at the same [Castaway Cafe](https://www.cohnrestaurants.com/castawaycafe) as the day before and then headed back to the cabana for hanging out by the pool. This time I got a bloody mary and the fish tacos. I actually didn't like the bloody mary that much but the fish tacos were excellent!

Not much to report poolside, although our cabana rental was only until 5 PM so we eventually got kicked out hah. I think I mixed up our days, because I'm pretty sure it was Friday that the guys grilled burgers for us.

Saturday
===
Final day :( Thankfully our flight was late -- like 5 PM -- so we had time for one last lunch and activity before heading back to Kahalui. We got packed up and left the resort around 11 AM.

We went to the [Maui Ocean Center Aquarium](https://mauioceancenter.com/). There's also a shopping center attached to the aquarium but we didn't really check it out. The aquarium is not cheap at 50 bucks a head and we weren't sure we'd have time to really enjoy it, but the lady at the desk said 2 hours is about enough time to see everything, which is about how much time we had. 

I was pleasantly surprised by how worthwhile it was. First, we could finally identify all the fish I had seen while snorkeling off the beach. Second, they had an incredibly 3D whale video experience that was really cool. While we had seen whales in the water, we really couldn't grasp their scale because they were so far away. Third, there was an aquarium spot on Hawaiian sharks that was really interesting.

For lunch, we got poke at a grocery store of all places, Foodland Kaahumanu haha. There was a poke stall at the back of the store that will give you a box with rice and two kinds of poke fish of your choice. I'm so used to poke bowls, I forgot poke fish by itself was its own concept. I still really liked it though!

Then we headed to the airport, dropped off the rental car and headed home. 

All in all, I really enjoyed Maui and Hawaii. March was an amazing time to visit on account of all the whales we saw from our hotel room. I definitely think we'll be coming back and next time I want to make sure I hit the [Road to Hana](https://www.hawaii-guide.com/maui/sights/road-to-hana).
