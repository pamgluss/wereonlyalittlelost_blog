After I was done visiting [Burlington](/tags/burlington/), I made my way back to New York to spend some time with friends. It was VERY hot while we were in town and I was working during the day so I'm going to collapse the trip into one big post with all the highlights.

Our friend lives in West Village and right around the corner from his apartment is the [Stonewall Inn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FJs3VMEWDEMcgWFU6) monument. It was pretty cool and sombering to run into it while strolling.

The cafe we got coffee at nearly daily and greatly enjoyed the quality of was called [Amano Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hzG5i62YFD3Pfe798) although our friend also recommended a cafe called [Qahwah House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LkQnuHus4hYNaSZG9) which was also quite good although a bit farther of a walk.

Wednesday night we had dinner at [Baar Baar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3Nv8HY19yrXPZ5Xx6), a tad of an upscale Indian restaurant. The quality of the food is great and thankfully not too spicy. I can see why this place is recommended.

Thursday night we had dinner at [Sushi Kai - West Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dM8kjq7kT2Edw66a9) which was superb! Highly recommend. We got the omakase or chef's pick. Each course was a delight to the senses and the palate. As an added bonus, it's BYOB so we were able to bring some beers from the apartment to have with dinner.

After dinner Thursday we took the metro to Gershwin Theater to see Wicked on Broadway. I've been on [Broadway in New York before](https://www.tumblr.com/wereonlyalittlelost/156160023916/we-went-and-saw-kinky-boots-on-broadway) but quite some time ago. I'd also never seen Wicked or listened to its music. It was great! No issues getting there or getting in and we had a wonderful time.

Friday we met up with some friends and did the [La Barca Cantina](https://labarcacantina.com/) taco cruise on the Hudson. It sounds kitschy and maybe overpriced but it exceeded my expectations! The shrimp and fish tacos were quite tasty and surprisingly spicy. Additionally, the margaritas didn't taste straight out of a cheap mix. Hudson Yards is so pretty!

As a bonus, we got to see the lit up Statue of Liberty!

Saturday I met up with some old college friends at a brunch spot called [Festival](https://www.festivalcafenyc.com/) which was a recommedation from another friend. The most key point was that we were able to make a reservation for 10 ahead of time and it was pretty quiet. The perfect spot to catch up and have drinks and food. While expensive, I did think the cocktails and food were quite tasty and worthwhile too. 

Sunday was a lazy day and Monday we flew home. All in all a good trip to New York City!
