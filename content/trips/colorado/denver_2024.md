My old coworkers from when [I lived in Austin](/trips/texas/) and I decided we'd meet up in Denver for hangouts and hiking. We spent some time both in the city of Denver and headed over to Rocky Mountain National Park.

### Rocky Mountain National Park

[RMNP](https://www.nps.gov/romo/index.htm) is about an hour and a half from Denver depending on where you're staying and how bad traffic is that day. We got there late and decided to do a few short hikes that branch off the main drive, Trail Ridge Road.

It's a one way road with incredible scenic vistas at each turn. It truly is breathtaking and well worth visiting just for that. We did one short hike with a waterfall:

And another longer hike down to a gorgeous meadow:

It's been too long to remember the first hike's name but according to my Garmin records, for the second we hiked at [Chapin Creek Trailhead](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/chapin-creek) and did about a 2 miles.

And here are some photos from vistas off the drive that are just jaw dropping.

As a general point of advice, the weather in Colorado can change really fast, especially at high elevations. It's also incredibly dry. So make sure you bring plenty of layers, even if you think you don't need them. And drink SO MUCH water, ideally with electrolytes.

Once we were up above the treeline, it got really windy and surprisingly cold so I was happy to have my long sleeved shirt.

### Denver

The next day, back in the city, you know I had to get [Snooze](https://www.snoozeeatery.com/) which at this point is probably controversial because it's become such a big chain. 

When I lived in Texas I absolutely LIVED for Snooze breakfast tacos and bloody marys. I had to have it again since I've been living in California. I'll be honest, it fully lived up to expectations!

And we hit up [Meow Wolf](https://meowwolf.com/), since at this point I've been to most of them.

I think my favorite is still the one in Santa Fe but the Denver one was still pretty fun.
