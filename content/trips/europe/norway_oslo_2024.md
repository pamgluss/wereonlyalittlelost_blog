In previous years I'd have written a daily journal for our trip with all the restaurants listed but I simply do not have time for that anymore! 

My partner and I were in Scandinavia for about ten days in 2024 with about 4 days in Oslo.

In spite of the short nature of the trip, we LOVED Oslo. In September it was great weather, and staying at the [Radisson Blu Plaza Hotel](https://www.radissonhotels.com/en-us/hotels/radisson-blu-oslo) was great for adjusting to the timezone and exploring the city.

### City Sights

The [National Museum - National Gallery](https://www.nasjonalmuseet.no/en/) was really cool, and we got to see The Scream.

Obviously with my penchant for taking skewed pictures you will need to just go and see it for yourself!

The [Oslo Opera House](https://www.operaen.no/en): We did a tour of the inside, then came back to watch Cinderella.

I don't remember the story with this art piece outside the Opera House but it's very cool:

### Outdoors

[Slottspark / Palace Park](https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/the-palace-park/228341/)

The palace:

The green boxes you see on the little island are bee hives!

We visited [Vigeland Park](https://vigeland.museum.no/en/vigelandpark)

I could post like 30 pictures from this park alone, it's well worth visiting.

And did a hike at [Kols√•stoppen](https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/hiking-to-kols%C3%A5stoppen/193263/), which was actually dope because we took public transit to the trail head! Then we hiked over the hill to another train station on the other side.

This was no small hike either, my Garmin recorded 5.05 miles with 1172 feet of elevation gain!

### Boat Cruise

Since our next stop was Copenhagen, I thought it'd be neat to take a boat cruise down the coast and get some fjord views.

I booked an overnight trip through [DFDS](https://www.dfds.com/en/passenger-ferries) which was nice because we didn't have to mess with an airport or airport security, and compared to a train ride we got to lay down in a real bed. Plus we got some unique views on the water!

Next stop, Copenhagen!
