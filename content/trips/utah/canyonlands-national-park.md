I've been in Salt Lake City since the previous Saturday night and have been loving working remotely from my friend's basement while her dogs watch.

We left around 10 AM for Moab and only stopped for groceries and gas before hitting the road. We did stop in Green River at the [Chow Hound](https://goo.gl/maps/78yoNAmF3jVuwxSt8) for lunch. I got the half pound burger which was pretty good but the ham sandwich Courtney got looked pretty meh. We do recommend the french fries though!

We arrived in Southern Utah with plenty of time to go drive into Canyonlands. We stopped at an overlook first:

The views of the La Sal mountains beyond the red rock canyons are so good! And Courtney said to prepare for even greater views in the following days at Arches.

There is a short hike you can do to [Mesa Arch](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/cany-mesa-arch.htm) which was my first run-in with an arch in Utah.

We didn't stay long in Canyonlands but it was an excellent introduction to the Utah Mighty Five.
