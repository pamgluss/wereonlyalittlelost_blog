While it's technically not a state park I'm including this hike in the "20 State parks of 2020" collection because I can. 

The park is really close to Austin and has only 2.5 miles of hiking but does have decent overlooks of hill country.

There's also good variety in things to see when in such a short span. We crossed a decently serene creek.

The waterfall doesn't really have a good vantage point but it looks decently impressive if you squint. If we could've gone down to the pool it would've been really pretty.

So for the convenience and for the fact it's more interesting than the greenbelt I recommend this spot for hiking in Austin.
