Today I got to wake up after sleeping on my other side to protect my new earring to Winter, my sister's dog, poking his nose around on my legs and butt. Thanks, dog!

We were going to walk to Grant Park to the farmer's market, but for some reason it wasn't there today. Still it was pleasant this morning and Winter was eager to get out of the house to do adventure. We didn't get into the park much but it looks nice enough and the entrance has this fountain which was neat.

And here's Winter being a good boy. Paula referred to him sniffing at the bushes of other people's houses as doggie Facebook which I thought was pretty cute.

Since the farmer's market wasn't there, we headed home and made breakfast of bacon, eggs and hashbrowns. Then we headed to our next stop, Coda, a shared workspace where the Georgia Tech grad students hang out and study together. I brilliantly forgot my computer charger, but I did bring [American Gods](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30165203-american-gods) and made good progress on my reading. Paula was helping one of her classmates out with stats homework

We were there for nearly five hours. Thankfully they have free coffee! While recharging with coffee, Paula let me know [this building has the tallest spiral staircase](https://atlanta.curbed.com/atlanta-development/2019/3/11/18259142/john-portman-coda-thyssenkrupp-georgia-tech-square) in the world. I believe the photo below was taken from the 16th floor out of 22!

We were getting hungry for dinner since we hadn't had lunch. Around 5:30 PM we headed out for Mary Mac's Tea Room which was only half a mile by walking. Unfortunately we totally forgot it was the Superbowl today!! So Mary Macs was closed by the time we got there. Still hungry and not in the mood to walk all the way back to the car, we crossed the street to [Torched Hop Brewing Company](http://www.torchedhopbrewing.com/). 

I got myself a flight, including two lagers, a sour and a mild IPA. Our waiter was from Portland and VERY knowledgable about the beer selection. All four were his recommendations and on point for what I was looking for.

We got a variety of appetizers that filled us up. We started with one of every steamed bun they had (except the mushroom) which included duck, fried chicken, bbq pork and bacon and jam. The fried chicken one was my favorite.

Paula wanted to try the fried avocado, so we got that. It wasn't at all like how I was expecting but I like tempura and I like avocado so it was quite good!

Finally we got the wings, 5 were habanero buffalo and the other 5 were honey sriracha. The waiter warned us the habanero buffalo would be "ten out of ten" spicy but they were nothing compared to the wings we had at the Vortex back at Christmas and certainly not the spiciest wings I've ever had. That said the wings were pretty tender and good quality and I liked the sauce on both.
