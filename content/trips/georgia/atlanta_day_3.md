Today is only a half day but we still had time to do stuff in between working and going to the airport so I figured I'd make a blog post.

Paula had a midterm today (which is partially why we were [spending so much time studying yesterday](../atlanta_day_2)) at 11 AM. I had to work a little in the morning so I spent some time at home reading emails, poking at Jira tickets and making sure there were no pull requests I should've been reviewing.

Paula and I headed to Georgia Tech campus, which gave me many flashbacks of my time at RIT. We got chocolate croissants at the GT equivalent of the SAU and sat by the classroom where her midterm would be. While she was suffering, I got a little work done. 

Afterwards we had enough time before my flight to check out [Mary Macs Tea Room](https://www.marymacs.com/). This place was a recommendation from my coworkers and was the place we couldn't go to the day prior. The dining room is huge! There was no wait and our food came out quickly. 

By being first time guests, we got complimentary "Pot Likker" which is collard greens and juice that you dip cornbread in. It sounds a little questionable, but Paula accurately described it as vegetarian chicken broth you might dip bread into. I ate all of mine! You can see a bottle with garlic in it in the front of the picture, that is garlic vinegar. I didn't actually get a chance to try it though.

I got the chicken tenders with sides of dumplings and tomato pie. Southern dumplings are _nothing_ like asian dumplings, in case you were wondering. Tomato pie is a Mary Mac's specialty that is somewhat like lasagna if there were no noodles, and also mayonnaise. That sounds a little gross but it's actually really tasty. I foolishly filled myself up with cornbread though so I had to box up nearly all of it.

We went from lunch straight to the airport where I made it to all of my flights without a hitch. I'm so happy to get a chance to see my sister and I'll be back in Atlanta in April for a conference!
