Today we went about an hour and a half North West of Austin. I have a list of 20 state parks to check off and I'm rapidly running out of ones that are close by!

The park website descriptions of the trails made them seem pretty bland. I've been keeping my expectations low on purpose and I wasn't disappointed. The signage to get to Pecan Flats wasn't very clear and we went the wrong way a couple of times.

The trail has some interesting features and a not terrible amount of elevation gain.

The cool thing about the lake were the trees poking up through the water and mud

Which you can see if you connect to the lake trail. If you skip the long sections you can keep the best parts of Pecan Flats and The Lake trail to roughly 3 ish miles according to my Fitbit.
