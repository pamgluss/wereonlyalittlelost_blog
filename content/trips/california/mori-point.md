I picked this hike off of Google Maps so I don't feel great about including it in the 2021 collection. That said, I believe we still clocked in 2 or 3 miles and there were some pretty steep parts. Anyways, Mori Point is part of Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy and is located in Pacifica. This is very, very similar to [Pillar Point Bluff](../pillar_point_bluff/) in its views. I would recommend Pillar Point over Mori Point though.

It was supposed to be cold and rainy but it was surpisingly nice on Saturday and Mori Point was VERY crowded. There wasn't much parking by the trailhead so I had to park in the neighborhood. That's not so bad though, I found parking that wasn't in front of anyone's house very easily.

The first part of the trail is along a boardwalk which has all the newly planted plants marked out with flags. There were tons of people down here because it leads to a flat beach.

This is the link to the [Mori Point Peak Loop Trail](https://www.parksconservancy.org/activities/hikes-views-wildflowers/mori-point-peak-loop) but I'm not sure that's what I actually did. I won't lie, we were pretty cavalier with reading the trail signs. We did head up the hill from the boardwalk up to the bluffs though.

Look at that ocean!

One thing to note about this place is the trails along the cliffs are pretty sketchy. They're thin, close to the edge and have quite a bit of gravel. I'm relieved I wore my actual hiking boots for this one. Even though the trail is short, there are very steep uphills and downhills.

Also try to find all the rock mazes! They seem to be quite popular.
