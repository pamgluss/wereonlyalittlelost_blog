My friend's flight was today so we knew we had to be back in San Francisco with time to spare. There seemed to be some scenic waterfall trails to do that were relatively short so we elected to try out [Kings Creek Falls](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hikekingscreekfalls.htm).

After our big peak hikes the two previous days this did feel like a break but it was NOT a simple 2.3 mile stroll. And it's not precisely a loop either, you can keep going after the falls to do a bigger loop that has offshoots if you want.

We ran into a couple who also said they saw a bear in the meadow nearby the entrance. We kept our eyes out for bears but didn't see them sadly.

This trail has some really beautiful green parts but also it's clear where the fire totally destroyed big sections. It's crazy to see.

At the actual waterful the viewing platform isn't the greatest angle and you can't get too close but it's still pretty. Worth seeing!

On the way back up you could go back the way you came or you can follow along the creek up a steep rocky stairway. Going up along the creek is totally worth it, it's gorgeous.

It is steep so take your time and watch your step!

And here's a picture just back at the top in the meadowy area closer to the parking area.

Considering the views and the flexibility of the hike to be longer or shorter, harder or easier, I'd highly recommend this hike for those staying a little longer at Lassen!

We managed to get back to San Francisco hitting some traffic. But thankfully in time for my friend to shower and us watch some TV before having to take my friend to the airport.
