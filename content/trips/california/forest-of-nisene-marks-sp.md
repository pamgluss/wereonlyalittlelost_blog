This is it folks, the last hike of 20 state parks in 2020! Did I fudge my goal? Yes. Was it fudged by a pretty wide margin? Also yes. But hey, you and I made it to the end of 2020 and for that we should take what we can get!

I wasn't sure this park would be open since the last I heard it was closed for the fires. The fires have been under control for some time, but, you never know. It was open, and looks like it was unscathed. 

Forest of Nisene Marks is south, near Scott's Valley. It has a [selection of hikes](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=28703) ranging from easy to quite difficult. I picked out the Maple Falls hike because I love waterfalls and the 7 mile distance seemed reasonable. Perhaps the line "[r]ecommended during the drier months, because heavy rains make access difficult and potentially dangerous" should have been a clue as to how this hike would be.

To start, we couldn't park at the Mary Porter parking lot because of a locked gate. So if you're going for the Loma Prieta trail or any of those trails further in, you'll want to add a short walk on the road to the total distance. Parking wasn't so bad though. We were initially nervous because where we paid the entrance fee were TONS of people. So many joggers and people pushing strollers. However, further in, we definitely ran into fewer people.

We crossed this insanely high up bridge:

And funnily enough there was a non operation payphone on the other side!

The fire road to get the trail was incredibly scenic, classic Santa Cruz mountain fair.

Combined with some questionable choices in how narrow landslide-prone trails could be handled. It wasn't a very wet winter (so far) but it was still damp and these wooden platforms were so sketchy!

There's no "Maple Falls" specific trail, you have to take Bridge Creek trail or Loma Prieta Grade trail. There's not really signage for the falls that we saw at all, actually. We took Bridge Creek trail and somehow missed the stairs to continue on to the falls and turned right, up a deer path or maybe bicycle path up the hillside to where [the map indicates "bottom of the incline"](https://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/666/files/TheForestOfNiseneMarksSPFinalWebLayout2018.pdf). We had the sense something was wrong because the incline was BRUTAL. How likely was it that a waterfall would be up a huge mountain? Thankfully there were people on bicycles at the top where it connects with a fire road who told us several people had been confused by the same path and told us to go back down and turn right.

Our phones just can't capture how steep this was but you can see how narrow the path is, almost like it was made by a bike tire.

You can see how relieved I am to have found the correct trail...

We felt pretty good about being on the correct trail. It follows the creek which... just, duh in retrospect. Bridge Creek trail, who would've thought. This used to be where logging happened, which might explain this fallen tree arrangement we saw

From here though it got terrifying all over again. The trail goes down and meets the creek, where you get to sort of choose your own adventure scramble over rocks and across the creek, under or over fallen trees, up narrow and slippery rocky paths... you name it. For example, this part of the path, where I used these tree roots as a ladder to scramble up this rock.

And this is not a short path either. It takes some time to Indiana Jones your way to the waterfall. There's a small clearing there for eating snacks and resting, and this waterfall.

Which, all said, is not so bad! It was getting on to 3 PM though and we certainly didn't want to be scrambling over rocks past dark, so we headed back the way we came. We could've done a partial loop by taking Loma Prieta back.

Just out and back with that small accidental blip landed us at 9.88 miles total! Plus ~1100 feet of elevation gain.

For dinner we went back to my customary burger and tried out [Betty's Burgers](http://www.bettyburgers.com/). There's a location right in Aptos outside the park but I think we were a little confused and ended up going to a location in Santa Cruz. I got the double burger with sauteed mushrooms which was HUGE. We agreed that we liked Phyllis' Giant Burgers [from outside of Samuel P Taylor](../samuel_p_taylor_sp) a bit better overall though.
