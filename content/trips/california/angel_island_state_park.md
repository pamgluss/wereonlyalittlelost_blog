We've been getting a lot of rain in San Francisco this season but we got a brief respite -- the perfect day to go on a local hike! We decided to check out [Angel Island State Park](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=468)

To get to Angel Island you must take a ferry, either from [Tiburon](https://angelislandferry.com/) or from the [ferry building in San Francisco](https://www.angelisland.com/sf-ferry). 

The San Francisco ferry only runs twice in the morning but is convenient in that it takes clipper cards, including clipper from your phone.

We elected to take the 10:50 AM ferry so that we had time to eat breakfast and pick up some sandwiches from a place in West Portal called [Submarine Center](https://goo.gl/maps/7gbDUy6GheTqkrys6). 

Sadly because of recent storms the state park wasn't doing bike rentals. There's a perimeter road that's bike safe that goes around the whole island which sounds pretty fun.

Since we were on foot though I wanted to climb to the top! [Livermore Peak](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/sunset-trail-to-mount-livermore) is a 4.25 mile hike and is 788 feet tall. So it's definitely not for small kids and is not accessible, with lots of steep steps and muddy sections.

You can see the recent wind storms tore up some trees, resulting in some less than ideal hiking conditions for the trail.

But overall worthwhile for the spectacular views at the top of the entire Bay Area. 

Also there's a picnic area at the summit that was perfect for eating our sandwiches and gazing out at the bridge.

The only downside is the next ferry was at 2:50 PM so we had to wait when we finished our hike for half an hour or so and there isn't much else to do.
