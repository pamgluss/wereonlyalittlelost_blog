I was in the Bay Area from Thursday to Monday but I had the FLU so I'm just going to write one blog post because I was pretty much dead for the entire time.

Thursday morning was when the flu hit me like a ton of bricks. I thought my head was exploding, I was sweaty and weak and had no appetite. For some hilarious reason I thought I had food poisoning, so I just popped an advil and got on the airplane and hoped for the best. Didn't question why I was freezing cold in the airport!

I got on BART and survived my 45 minute train ride downtown, where I survived a half mile walk to my friends' apartment. They weren't home, so I fell into their guest bed at 7:30 PM and was fast asleep.

Friday day was work/career stuff. I barely survived that, then Ted picked me up and brought me back to Redwood City to see Jessica and her coworkers. We got drinks (and by we I mean they, I just had a few tater tots) at [Dog Haus Biergarten](http://belmont.doghaus.com/). I held my own but it was good to head back to Jess and Ted's house for pajamas and youtube.

Saturday my brother picked me up and we went to [Alice's](http://www.alicesrestaurant.com/) which at this point I shouldn't tag anymore because we go there so damn often. We met Tyler and my Dad there, I got my usual BMW burger but could only eat half of it.

That night Jessica brought me down to [Omescape Sunnyvale](https://omescape.us/) to do the Chaos in the Galleria escape room. It's 90 minutes and pretty in depth. There are four or five rooms you need to explore and solve puzzles in. I didn't find it too difficult to be helpful either! I found the puzzles a little more obvious than what we experienced at Boda Borg.

Sunday Jess and I headed up to San Francisco to see Ashley and Cameron at their place (the very same place I had stayed Thursday night). We walked to lunch at [Ippudo Ramen](https://ippudony.com/location/#gtSF) which was fine but I still wasn't feeling well enough to eat all my food or really properly enjoy it.

I missed my flight at 6 so I headed back down to Redwood City for an early bed.

Monday, my brother came back to get me and we went out to lunch with my dad at [Breakers Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/breakers-cafe-redwood-city). It may only have 3 stars and may be a random diner in a plaza in a random small town in the Bay Area but Breakers is one of my go to cheap diner spots. 

Finally my brother took me to the airport (early!) and I headed back to Austin.
