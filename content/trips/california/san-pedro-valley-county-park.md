Once again my girl over at [Trees and Tents](https://www.treesandtents.com/trailguide/brooks-falls-loop/) provided me with an in depth trail description and recommendation. I followed her instructions for the Brooks Falls Loops to a T, but it's been dry lately so there was no waterfall. 

One thing I noticed right off the bat was how many critters there are here! I saw deer, tons of birds, chipmunks and even a rabbit. I suspect with the proximity to Pacifica that a lot of these guys aren't too afraid of humans because these deer were very chill.

Trees and Tents suggests taking Montara Mountain first for better views of the ocean. Currently this is the only way to do it, since the loop is one way on account of COVID.

This section of the hike was pretty steep in my opinion, which made it surprising that she suggested this was a family friendly hike. She was correct in saying the trail markers are extremely clear and easy to follow, and pretty much every major vista point has a convenient bench to sit down at and admire Pacifica, the ocean and the mountains. There was a couple at the really spectacularly located bench and I didn't want to interrupt them, but it was right at the junction of Montara Mountain Peak and Brooks Creek Trail.

Once I headed down Brooks Creek it was all downhill and had some really spectacular views of the mountains. The sun was at a weird angle to me but I tried my best. It bends around into a valley of similar shaped and colored hills and it's really beautiful. I suspect my phone camera is not equipped for the task.

I think it's around there that you should see the waterfall, which is supposedly 175 feet tall. You do start to hear water running as you get further down, but the creek is covered in plant life so there's not really water you can see. I did take a picture of these fallen trees over the water that I thought was cool.

Take Trout Farm Trail the rest of the way back to the visitor center.

At this point I was still feeling pretty energetic so I tried out the [Hazelnut Trail](https://parks.smcgov.org/hazelnut-trail). It's a 3.7 miles one way trail, so I just went up about 1.2 ish miles until it started going back down again, then turned around and headed back. I thought it was fine but you definitely get more out of the Montara Mountain trail. I also think the fact it is out and back is a huge disadvantage. 

Still, it had its upsides:

Right at that tree is where I turned around.

All in all I believe I hit about 5 miles walking. I stopped at the same In N Out as yesterday for my customary burger. My legs are going to be sore this week!
