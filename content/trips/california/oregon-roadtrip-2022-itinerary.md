I thought it might be nice to include a bulleted list of destinations and resources so that if you're planning your own trip, you can just grab information from here without having to dig through all my journals. Of course, I still recommend looking through the rest of the blog posts to see detailed advice and thoughts plus pictures!

Coming up the California coast to Oregon, here's what I did and where I stayed.
* [Orr Hot Springs](https://www.orrhotsprings.org/)
* [Jug Handle Creek Farm](https://www.jughandlecreekfarm.org/) - private campsite near Mendocino CA
* [Russian Gulch State Park](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=432) and I did the Russian Gulch Waterfall Trail
* Shopped a bit and ate in Mendocino, specifically at [Eggheads](https://fortbraggrestaurants.com/eggheads) for lunch.
* Drove through [Avenue of the Giants](https://www.visitredwoods.com/explore-the-redwoods/avenue-of-the-giants/)
* [Prairie Creek Redwoods SP Gold Bluffs Beach](https://www.visitredwoods.com/listing/gold-bluffs-beach-%26-campground/529/) - campsite
* [Trillium Falls trail](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hiking-trilliumfalls.htm)
* Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park - hiked the [Boyscout Tree Trail](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/boyscouttrail.htm)
