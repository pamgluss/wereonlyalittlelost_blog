First post of 2021! Welcome to the new year y'all! This year my focus is definitely going to be on things inside my house or within driving distance so it is gonna be a quiet year for the blog. I'm thinking this will age better than [this post from 2019...](https://wereonlyalittlelost.tumblr.com/post/189990481466/happy-2020)

When it was coming down to the wire on my 2020 hiking goals, I heard about some of the Peninsula city parks and put them in my tracking document. I live in Burlingame, so [Mills Canyon](https://bahiker.com/southbayhikes/mills.html) being only a few miles from me was appealing. I think you get what you ask for when you hike a city park. It is very small and throughout the 1.4 mile loop you can see people's houses and encounter roads.

That's not to say this isn't pretty. The trail encounters a stream, there are trees and rocks. There is a decent overlook.

I just think when you can drive 20 minutes and be in the Santa Cruz mountains that you would only come here if you lived very close by.

Since the hike was so short, we ended up driving over to the [Bay Trail](https://goo.gl/maps/GcYHzMLdCyequK7m6) to walk along the bay. If you're looking for another thing to fill your day in Burlingame, that's a really lovely walk along the water with great views. Downtown Burlingame is very close by to there as well.
