Oh hey! Bet you thought you'd seen the last of me! :D

To be honest, blogging is HARD WORK. I think I was writing way too much for previous trips and I think I'll be switching to a highlight style blog post so you guys get the info you need without wading through a bunch of my rambling.

So let's get to it! 

We were in Pinnacles in July of 2024 which is absolutely NOT the right time to go. It gets incredibly hot and gets hot pretty early (akin to Texas, like when we hiked at [Big Bend](https://www.tumblr.com/wereonlyalittlelost/tagged/big%20bend%20national%20park)). 

The plus side is that the campground has a swimming pool, so during the hot parts of the day we were able to sit in the pool and drink Whiteclaws. The pool is open (weather permitting) April 1st - September 30th.

Since it was so hot we originally decided to stick to [Moses Spring to Rim Trail Loop](https://www.nps.gov/pinn/planyourvisit/trails.htm) described as an easy 2.2 miles with great views. Which, it totally does!

Totally worth it just to get to the reservoir, which is a great spot for a snack and water break.

For some of us, that wasn't good enough though, so we kept going after the reservoir on Chalone Peak Trail which can be 9 miles round trip although we stopped early and turned around, getting to a total of 5.9 miles instead. Worth it for the views!

It was so hot that on Sunday we just packed up camp and headed home haha. But overall I would say the camping trip was good, just plan to come back in the shoulder months when it's a bit cooler. 

For all California National Parks I really think you need to book REALLY far in advance to get optimal campgrounds.
